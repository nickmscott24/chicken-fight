# Chicken Fight

## Let's Go Gambling!

In this program, you can bet it all on your star chicken and either win big, or hope you have enough left to try again.
The game continues until you either give up or run out of money.  See how much you can win in Chicken Fight! 


## Basic Overview

* The player will start with $50 and a single chicken to begin with.
* Starting the game will prompt the player with two choices: play or quit the program.
* By selecting play, a prompt to name the first chicken will appear; afterwards, they can bet any amount of money within their budget, whether it be $5 or all-in.
* Once the name and bet are decided, the chicken will fight another random chicken. Both chickens start with 100 HP and can deal anywhere between 10 and 30 damage.
* Should the player win, they will receive their wagered amount, and a prompt to play again, open the store, or quit will appear.
* Should they lose, they will be notified that their starting chicken has perished in combat, and they will need to purchase a new chicken to keep playing if they have enough to buy another; otherwise, the program will automatically quit after telling the player they lost.
* Opening the store will allow the player to purchase a new chicken.
* Once a new chicken is bought, the player can name it just as before and continue to the betting.
* Wins will be tracked until the player is unable to play again due to financial issues or quits.
